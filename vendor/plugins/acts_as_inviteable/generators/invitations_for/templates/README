You may wish to customize the routes that were added.
You will need to actually set up your InvitationController and it's views to fit your needs.
You'll also need to make sure your "UsersController" (or whatever the resource you use is called)
has a "new" action and that it and the view handles the "invite_code" param correctly.
    
Be sure to run rake db:migrate.
If you want to, you may want to change the default invitation limit first in the migration file.
